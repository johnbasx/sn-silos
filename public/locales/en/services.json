    "description": "Land quality may be defined as the ability of the land to perform specific functions without becoming degraded. It should be noted that this definition contains an element of time as it implies the sustainability of performance functions. This is a marked departure from previous definitions, which consider land quality as a static attribute. Among the numerous functions that land must perform are to produce food and fiber, maintain or enhance water quality, support human habitation, partition water flow, and sequester carbon. For the purpose of the present study, we selected the function of the land to sustain grain production, which presumes that the land responds positively to cultural practices conducive to sustainable land management. We chose grain production because it is a decisive factor that controls food security, which is emerging as a major geopolitical issue.",
